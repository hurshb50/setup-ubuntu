# setup-ubuntu

## Publishing

The repo includes two GitHub Actions workflows.

- `publish.yaml` checks, tests, builds, bumps the version, tags it, and stages the package on npm.
- `release.yaml` publishes a GitHub release once the version is live.

CI uses npm's OIDC trusted publishing and staged publishing. No npm token. Nothing goes live until you approve it with 2FA.

## One-time setup

1. Push the repo to GitHub. Run `gh auth login` first if needed.

   ```bash
   git init -b main
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   gh repo create setup-ubuntu --public --source . --remote origin --push
   ```

2. Log in to npm.

   ```bash
   vp pm login
   ```

3. Publish the first version manually. npm cannot stage a new package.

   ```bash
   vp pm publish
   ```

   This publishes 0.0.0. Later releases go through CI.

4. Allow GitHub Actions to publish. In the package settings on npmjs.com, add a GitHub Actions trusted publisher.

   - Organization or user: `hurshb50`
   - Repository: `setup-ubuntu`
   - Workflow filename: `publish.yaml`
   - Allowed actions: staged publishing only

5. Optional: in package settings under Publishing access, set "Require two-factor authentication and disallow tokens". CI still works through OIDC.

## Releasing a version

```bash
gh workflow run publish.yaml -f bump=patch
```

Use `minor` or `major` instead of `patch` when it fits. Then approve the staged package.

```bash
vp pm stage list
vp pm stage approve <stage-id>
```

You can also approve on npmjs.com under Staged Packages. The Release workflow creates the GitHub release on its weekly run. Run `gh workflow run release.yaml` to do it now.
